<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

Last week we covered the concept of distances in euclidean space, and how machines interpret similarity and dissimilarity. We also saw how machines partition datasets into clusters via hierarchical clustering.

***

This week we will cover classification using K-nearest neighbours. Many of the concepts from last week are carried forward to this week, however the objective of classification tasks is not to perform an exploratory data analysis, but rather we are interested in training a model to learn the features of a specific group (cancer type, flower species) and to correctly place new 'unseen data' into the correct group.

***

Designing a classifier can be broken into the following steps:

1. Identify the dataset and split it into a training and validation set.
