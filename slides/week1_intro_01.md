# What is Genomics?

- Genomics applies recombinant DNA methods, DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics algorithms to sequence, assemble and analyse the structure and function of an organisms genome. 

The field of genomics can be broadly divided into 5 sub-categories:

1. Comparative genomics
2. Epigenomics
3. Functional genomics
4. Phylogenomics
5. Personalised genomics

# Comparative Genomics

Notes: 

- Common features of two organisms will often be encoded within DNA that is conserved between the species.

- More precisely, the DNA sequences encoding the proteins and RNAs responsible for functions that were conserved from the last common ancestor should be preserved in contemporary genome sequences.

- Likewise, the DNA sequences controlling the expression of genes that are regulated similarly in two related species should also be conserved.

- Conversely, sequences that encode (or control the expression of) proteins and RNAs responsible for differences between species will themselves be divergent.

# Epigenomics

Notes:

- Epigenomics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that are independent of changes in DNA sequence. 

- More broadly, we can say epigenomics is the study of changes in phenotype that reflect nongenetic aleritions in a cell or organism.

# Functional Genomics

Notes: 

- Functional genomics involves measuring the expression level of genes in cells that exist in different physiologic, pathological or developmental conditions.

- Gene expression is measured by quantifying the amount of RNA in the cell, which can be mapped back to the DNA sequence from which it came. Multiple hits mapping to the same gene would indicate that the gene is being highly expressed *in the condition being studied*.

# Phylogenomics

Notes: 

- Phylogenetics is the study of how different species are related. We can say that phylogenetics is looking back in the evolutionary time to trace the history of species or a group of species.

- This evolutionary history of a group of organisms can be represented in a diagram called a phylogenetic tree.

# Personalised Genomics

Notes: 

- Reduced costs of sequencing DNA means clinicians may opt to have their patients genome sequenced.

- Personalised genomics can be used as a screening tool to confirm the presence or absence of genetic diseases. This is particularly relevant for children of parents that are homozygous for pathogenic variants.

- In the event a genetic disease is found, personalised genomics can inform the best course of action for therapeutic treatments. This branch of personalised genomics is called pharmacogenomics, which can predict which drugs will be most effective against the disease, whilst minimising negative side effects for the patient.

- Commercial kits available to order online: [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/en-eu/) (tests disease related genetic markers) & [Dante Labs](https://www.dantelabs.com/) (performs whole genome sequencing).
